# Solving_RLC_Circuits_with_n_Loops

This Project was about solving an RLC Circuit for loop currents having n loops and 2 independent AC voltage sources having different phases.
The numerical method, Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR) was required to be applied. The SOR equations are adapted from Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successive_over_relaxation).

The Circuit with n loop is given below:

If you want to know how the circuit was converted into the form of simultaneous linear equation and matrix form, kindly see the PDF file.

If you want to know about MATLAB implemenation of solving the circuit for current the SOR equations, please see the m-file and run it on MATLAB. 

Hope you like it.
